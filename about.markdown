<center><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-brighter"><b>Alan (The Brighter)</b></a> is a versatile individual focused on 3D modeling, cybersecurity, and data analysis.</center>

## Background

I have experience working in IT, assisting with the assembly, maintenance, and troubleshooting of computers, providing customer support, and helping with server setup. Over the years, I've developed skills in 3D art, particularly architectural visualization (archviz), as well as an increasing interest in cybersecurity and data analysis.

I am actively expanding my knowledge in the areas of cybersecurity, 3D modeling, and data analysis. 

## Current Focus

- 3D Modeling: I specialize in creating 3D environments, vehicles, and characters using Blender and Substance Painter.
- Cybersecurity: I'm currently exploring pentesting, ethical hacking, and network security, with plans to dive deeper into Linux and networking.
- Data Analysis: I'm studying courses in Power BI, Excel, and Python, and I aim to build projects and solve problems through platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.

## Key Skills

- 3D modeling and visualization (Blender, Unreal Engine)
- Cybersecurity (Pentesting, Active Directory, Networking)
- Data analysis (Excel, Python, Power BI, SQL)
- Strong analytical skills and problem-solving

## Projects

I have worked on various projects, including:

- **3D Modeling**: I’ve created detailed 3D models of vehicles (e.g., Motoplan Carl Jurisch’s 1957) and environments (medieval RPG map).
- **Cybersecurity**: I’ve set up Active Directory and explored penetration testing concepts.
- **Data Analysis**: I’m in the process of building a portfolio of data projects and enhancing my skills with Power BI and Python.
